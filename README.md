# Go GoL

A simple playground for implementing Conway's Game of Life in Go.

```bash
$ go install github.com/carise/golgo
$ golgo
```

Some ideas for extending:
* [done] Use some kind of ncurses or GUI to display the automata
* Parallel processing of grid
* Colors?
* Config/flags/etc. for size
* Random seed
